##Terms And Conditions

###Pricing
Lupoex charges 0.025% (or 0.00025 represented as a decimal) of any offer created through the platform.
This means that any offer that you issue will be created at 99.975% of the value entered.
For example, suppose you create an offer to sell 100 BTC. The actual offer created will be for 99.975 BTC with 0.025 BTC being sent as a payment to the Lupoex account.

Additionally, for every transaction performed on the stellar network, there is a minimal XLM charge by the stellar network itself.
These charges will probably not be noticed by the average user as they are very small (0.0001 XLM per operation.
Please note that offer creation through Lupoex actually produces two operations, the creation of the offer as well as the payment of the 0.025% fee.

###Disclaimer
We at Lupoex take testing and bug elimination seriously. We strive to provide you a worry and bug free experience.
However, if a bug does present itself in stellar or our platform, we will not be held responsible for any funds lost.
We encourage users to try out our <a href="http://test.lupoex.com" target="_blank">test system</a> as well as perform operations with small amounts of funds before using our system with large amounts of funds.
