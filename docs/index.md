# Welcome to the Lupoex

### What is Lupoex
Lupoex is a top of the line trading client that connects to the Stellar decentralized exchange.
Our mission is to provide you with a smooth and intuitive trading experience while empowering you to take control of your finances.

### What is Stellar
Stellar is a leading decentralized exchange. In other words, Stellar is a network of nodes (run by various institutions, companies and individuals)
which comes to consensus about exchange related data every few seconds. With Stellar, there is no single point of failure at which the exchange can fail and no third party exchange which
to which you need to entrust your money. Instead, all trade occurs on the network. To trade, just create an account on the network and start trading. You maintain control over your money at all times!

### What this means for you!

With Lupoex and Stellar, there is no need to deposit your money on some third party exchange so that you can trade.
Instead, you can maintain an account of various assets that you control directly. At any moment you can rebalance your account or cash out.
