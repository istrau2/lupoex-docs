##Create an account
A stellar account consists of two pieces of information:

1. A public key. This key is not private and is the address you give to others so that they can send you lumens or other assets.
2. A secret key. This is HIGHLY SENSITIVE information. If anyone gains access to your secret key, they can take all of the assets in your account anonymously and completely. Additionally, if you lose this secret key, you will lose access to all of the assets in your account for good. Secret keys cannot be recovered. Be sure to store your secret key in a secure and reliable manner.

###Generating your keypair
The first step in creating a stellar account is generating the two keys mentioned above (together called a keypair). Click the 'GENERATE KEY PAIR' button to generate your keys.
After clicking the button, you should see the two keys appear on the screen. Every time you click the button, a new keypair will be generated.

After you have generated you keypair (and secured your secret key), you need to fund your account for it to actually be created on the stellar network.

###Funding your account
You must fund your account with stellar's native currency lumens (XLM) so that the account can exist and perform operations. We recommend a minimum of 100 XLM.
Click the 'Changelly' button to be redirected to our partners at Changelly where you can fund your new accounts with lumens using BTC, USD (via credit card) and many other methods.
Until you fund your account, it will not exist on the stellar network and you will not be able to log in and view that account (this is to prevent malicious users from spamming the network with millions of empty accounts for free).

After you have funded your account, it will exist on the stellar network. You can then [log in to your account](/getting-started/log-in).
