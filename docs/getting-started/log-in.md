##Log In

Once you have a Stellar account, logging in is super easy:

1. Click on the user icon on the right side of the navbar.
2. Login with your Stellar account's public key (or a federated address)

!!! tip
    A federated address is one where you trust a third party to remember you public key. To learn more about federation see the <a href="https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/federation.html" target="_blank">Official Federation Concept Guide</a>
    
Have no fear, your public key is not sensitive at all. In fact, logging in to Lupoex does not involve any secure information.
Instead, logging in just means that you will be able to view your account's data (but not modify it). In order to modify an account's data
(e.g. modify an asset balance by making a trade) you need the secret key, which is highly sensitive.

That's it, you are now logged in to Lupoex. You can now [view a market](/getting-started/view-your-first-market).
