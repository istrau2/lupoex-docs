##Getting Started

###Overview
Lupoex allows you to search through the many markets on stellar and create offers and trades. Additionally, Lupoex offers account viewing and payments (to other stellar accounts). 
You don't need a stellar account to view the markets. However, in order to get started trading on Lupoex you are going to need a Stellar account. Yes, that's right, a Stellar account.
Since Lupoex is just a portal to the Stellar network, there is no 'Lupoex Account'.
Instead, you create a Stellar account and log in with that.
