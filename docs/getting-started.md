##Getting Started
In order to get started using Lupoex you need a Stellar account. Yes, that's right, a Stellar account. Since Lupoex is just a portal to the Stellar network, there is no 'Lupoex Account'.
Instead, you create a Stellar account and log in with that.

###Creating an account
While we have plans for enabling Stellar account creation from the Lupoex platform, for now, creating a Stellar account via Lupoex is not supported.
That said, creating a Stellar account outside of Lupoex is not difficult:
1. Go to the <a href="https://www.stellar.org/account-viewer" target="_blank">Stellar Account Viewer</a>
    * Generate a keypair
    * Copy down your public and secret keys (IMPORTANT: while your public key can be sent to other people without fear, your secret key is HIGHLY SENSITIVE. Anyone with access to your secret key has full control over any and all assets in your account. Be sure to store your secret key in a secure manner).
2. Buy some Lumens (Ticker is XLM except on poloniex.com where the ticker is STR) on your favorite cryptocurrency exchange that sells lumens.
3. Send your Lumens to your public key.

That's it. You now have a Stellar account.

##Logging In

Once you have a Stellar account, logging in is super easy:
1. Click on the user icon on the right side of the navbar.
2. Login with your Stellar account's public key

!!! tip
    Have no fear, your public key is not sensitive at all. In fact, logging in to Lupoex does not involve any secure information.
    Instead, logging in just means that you will be able to view your account's data (but not modify it). In order to modify an account's data
    (e.g. modify an asset balance by making a trade) you need the secret key, which is highly sensitive.


That's it, you are now logged in to Lupoex. You can now [view a market](/viewing-your-first-market).
